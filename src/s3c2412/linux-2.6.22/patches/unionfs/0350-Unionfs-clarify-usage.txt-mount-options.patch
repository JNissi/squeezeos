-# mount -t unionfs -o branch-option[,union-options[,...]] none MOUNTPOINT
+GENERAL SYNTAX
+==============
 
-The available branch-option for the mount command is:
+# mount -t unionfs -o <OPTIONS>,<BRANCH-OPTIONS> none MOUNTPOINT
+
+OPTIONS can be any legal combination one of:
+
+- ro		# mount file system read-only
+- rw		# mount file system read-write
+- remount	# remount the file system (see Branch Management below)
+- incgen	# increment generation no. (see Cache Consistency below)
+
+BRANCH-OPTIONS can be either (1) a list of branches given to the "dirs="
+option, or (2) a list of individual branch manipulation commands, described
+in the "Branch Management" section below.
+
+The syntax for the "dirs=" mount option is:
 
 	dirs=branch[=ro|=rw][:...]
 
-specifies a separated list of which directories compose the union.
-Directories that come earlier in the list have a higher precedence than
-those which come later. Additionally, read-only or read-write permissions of
-the branch can be specified by appending =ro or =rw (default) to each
-directory.
+The "dirs=" option takes a colon-delimited list of directories to compose
+the union, with an optional branch mode for each of those directories.
+Directories that come earlier (specified first, on the left) in the list
+have a higher precedence than those which come later.  Additionally,
+read-only or read-write permissions of the branch can be specified by
+appending =ro or =rw (default) to each directory.
