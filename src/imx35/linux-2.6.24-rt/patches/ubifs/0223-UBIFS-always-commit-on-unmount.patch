Subject: [PATCH] UBIFS: always commit on unmount

UBIFS commits on unmount to make the next mount faster. Currently,
it commits only if there is more than LEB size bytes in the
journal. This is not very good, because journal size may be
large (512KiB). And there may be few deletions in the journal
which do not take much journal space, but which do introduce
a lot of TNC changes and make mount slow.

Thus, jurt remove this condition and always commit.
