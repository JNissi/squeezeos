1.	Find a suitable directory to start from (best done from a
	non root account for overall safety:

		$ cd $HOME

		$ tar tzvf wavplay-1.0.tar.gz | less

	This displays the contents of the archive (you should always
	do this before unpacking it)	

2.	Unpack the archive:

		$ tar xzvf wavplay-1.0.tar.gz

	This creates a subdirectory ./wavplay-1.0 where all the
	extracted files should go.

3.	Change to the new directory:

		$ cd wavplay-1.0

4.	Make some decisions about this install (there are
	more than this, but these are the important ones):

	4.1 Are you installing everything (default)? Or
	    are you installing only wavplay and wavrec,
	    because you don't support X, or lack MOTIF/LessTif?
	    (just decide at this point)

	4.2 What CPU(s) will this software run on? If it is to
	    run on any platform (or 386), then comment out the
	    line that specifies 'CPU=-m486'.

	4.3 Where do you want wavplay, wavrec and possibly
	    xltwavplay executables intalled? By default:

		INSTDIR=/usr/local/bin

	4.4 Where is your sound interface device installed?
	    Default is DSPPATH= -DAUDIODEV=\"/dev/dsp\"
	    (ie. /dev/dsp)

	    IF INSTALLING XLTWAVPLAY ONLY :

	4.5 If installing X based xltwavplay, do you want
	    to compile it with builtin fallback resources
	    (default and easiest/laziest)?  Or instead, would
	    you rather have the resource file installed for
	    it so that you can customize colours and fonts
	    etc.? (See USERES=-DINSTALLED_RESOURCE_FILE)

	4.6 If installing the resource file in 4.5, where
	    would you like it installed? Default is:

		RESDIR=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults

	4.7 If installing xltwavplay, do you want it to
	    be EDITRES capable? If not sure, leave it as
	    default (yes). (See NOEDITRES=-DNO_EDITRES,
	    and LIBXMU=-lXmu)

5.	Edit the Makefile to reflect your decisions:

		$ emacs Makefile

	Each configurable item has comment text above it for
	explanation, so I'm won't repeat it all here.

6.	Check Makefile settings: some things _MUST_ be set
	properly before the make can be successful:

	CPU=-m486		Change you're using a 386
				(by commenting it out)

	INSTDIR=/usr/local/bin	Change if you don't want to
				install here!

	RESDIR=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults
				Change this if you chose to
				install a resource file for
				xltwavplay (if you're not
				installing xltwavplay, then
				ignore this)
	
	DSPPATH=-DAUDIODEV=\"/dev/dsp\"
				Change this line if your
				audio device is not /dev/dsp

	DSPLOCKS= -DAUDIOLCK=0x33333333
				Change this if you want to use
				a different IPC Key for your
				semaphores. Normally, this
				default is probably fine.

7.	Before starting, and/or if you've made changes to the
	Makefile, start clean by doing:

		$ make real_clean

8.	If you are making all of the source, just type:

		$ make

	This should compile wavplay, wavrec and xltwavplay. If
	you have problems linking xltwavplay, check the top
	portion of the Makefile. There are some hints about
	things to check there.

	If you don't want the X based stuff, make as:

		$ make no_x

	NOTE: Please ignore all compile warnings about rcsid,
	like the one:

	main.c:38: warning: `rcsid' defined but not used

	There should be a maximum of one of these per source
	module. This is not a bug.

9.	Gain install privileges:

		$ su -

	(or login in as root)

10.	If installing everything, just type:

		# make install

	If not installing the X based client program, then
	use:

		# make install_no_x

11.	Test. Try wavplay on an existing wav file:

		$ wavplay diddly.wav

	If you don't hear anything, please check your mixer
	(volume settings etc.)

	Also check that you don't have another older one
	installed:

		$ wavplay --version

	should indicate version 1.0.


	FOR XLTWAVPLAY:

	From an xterm session try:

		$ xltwavplay &

	IF that works, edit your .fvwm2rc file (or whatever)
	and add it there, so that it will be at your beckon
	call.

12.	Get more milk and cookies!

13.	Read the file BUGS! There are some things in there
	that you should know about. Especially in respect
	to xltwavplay and LessTif. Really.

14.	ENJOY!
