This key is a default key to ensure that boot time is fast during developping time. In order to put your own host key you can use the following commands:

/usr/bin/dropbearkey -t rsa -f /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key

or

/usr/bin/dropbearkey -t dss -f /etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key

/etc/init.d/rcS already has code to generate a rsa key if no key is found.

Just like any file stored in yaffs if you have a problem login using ssh you can erase the yaffs partition and come back to the factory settings.
